This project relies on the following libraries:

1. [**illuminate/database**](https://github.com/illuminate/database) ‚Äî A full-featured database toolkit for PHP, providing an expressive query builder, ActiveRecord-style ORM, and schema builder. It is also the database layer used in the Laravel framework.

## üöÄ Usage
